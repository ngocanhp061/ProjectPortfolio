Hello Guys!
Welcome to my list of Projects.
The list includes:
  1. Project 1: Where I analyzed Covid Death in 2020-2021. I did share my SQL code file, my Tableau dashboard and my written-analysis there. Feel free to check them all!
  2. Project 2: Where I visualized to see the difference in survival opportunities between different people in Titanic disaster. It is a Python file code and I will update my written analysis soon.
